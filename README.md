# assimReservoirs

The aim of this package is the assimilation of reservoir extents in Cear√°, northeast Brazil. 
With the use of meteorological observations, the reservoir extent shall be modeled in order to complement the reservoir extent estimations based on remote sensing [jmigueldelgado/buhayra](https://github.com/jmigueldelgado/buhayra). 

<br>

#### Available funcions:

- ```identBasinsGauges(ID, distGauges)``` identifies the contributing basins of a certain reservoir and the precipitation gauges within a certain buffer around this basin

- ```plotBasins(list_output)``` plots the identified contributing basins

- ```plotGauges(list_output, distGauges)``` plots the identified rain gauges within the given distance, which allows to check if an adequate number of rain gauges is included for the interpolation 

- ```requestGauges(requestDate, Ndays, list_output)``` requests api rain data for the above selected rain gauges

- ```idwRain(list_output, api)``` interpolates rain data using idw (inverse distance weighted) interpolation

- ```plotIDW(list_output, list_idw)``` plots the result of ```idwRain```: the interpolated precipitation in the contributing basins

- ```resRouting(list_output)``` creates a routing scheme for the strategic reservoirs (= reservoirs on the main river course) - for each reservoir the next reservoir downstream is identified

- ```plotStratRes(list_output, list_routing)``` plots the strategic reservoirs identified by resRouting


<br>

#### Future functions:

- include radar data and combine it with the data from the rain gauges for more reliable precipitation data

- water balance to calculate the reservoir extent and compare it to the extent estimated from remote sensing

<br>

#### Example:

```
library(assimReservoirs)

list_output <- identBasinsGauges(ID = 25283, distGauges = 20)
plotBasins(list_output)
plotGauges(list_output, distGauges = 20)

api <- requestGauges(requestDate = today(), Ndays = 5, list_output)
list_idw <- idwRain(list_output, api)
plotIDW(list_output, list_idw)

list_routing <- resRouting(list_output)
plotStratRes(list_output, list_routing)
```
