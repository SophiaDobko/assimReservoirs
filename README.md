# assimReservoirs

The aim of this package is the assimilation of reservoir extents in Cear√°, northeast Brazil. 
With the use of meteorological observations, the reservoir extent shall be modeled in order to complement the reservoir extent estimations based on remote sensing [jmigueldelgado/buhayra](https://github.com/jmigueldelgado/buhayra). 

<br>

#### Available funcions:

- ```identBasinsGauges(ID, distGauges)``` identifies the contributing basins of a certain reservoir and the precipitation gauges within a certain buffer around this basin

- ```plotBasins(list_output)``` plots the identified contributing basins

- ```plotGauges(list_output, distGauges)``` plots the identified rain gauges within the given distance, which allows to check if an adequate number of rain gauges is included for the interpolation 

- ```requestGauges(requestDate, Ndays, list_output)``` requests api rain data for the above selected rain gauges

- ```idwRain(list_output, api)``` interpolates rain data using idw (inverse distance weighted) interpolation

- ```plotIDW(list_output, list_idw)``` plots the result of ```idwRain```: the interpolated precipitation in the contributing basins

- ```resRouting.R``` 

<br>

#### Future functions:

- include radar data and combine it with the data from the rain gauges for more reliable precipitation data

- water balance to calculate the reservoir extent and compare it to the extent estimated from remote sensing
